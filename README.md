# Sorting Visualizer

The sorting visualizer serves the mere purpose of visualization of 5 Sorting Algorithms namely Selection sort, Bubble Sort, Merge sort, Insertion Sort and Shell Sort with the help of JS Functions. It also provides the Time and Space Complexities of the algorithm currently running.

Take a look at the [Sorting Visualizer](https://krithika117.github.io/sorting-visualizer/) :)

## Algorithms
1. Selection sort - It is an in-place, unstable, comparison algorithm. This means that it transforms the input collection using no auxiliary data structures and that the input is overridden by the output (in-place algorithm).
2. Bubble Sort - Sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
3. Merge sort - Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Merge sort continuously cuts down a list into multiple sublists until each has only one item, then merges those sublists into a sorted list.
4. Insertion Sort - Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
5. Shell Sort - Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm. It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted. The interval between the elements is reduced based on the sequence used.
